                    <h2> Main Airbnb hotspots </h2>
                    <p> The map shown on the right analyses the main Airbnb hotspots and location separated by different counties. 
                        From here, it can be seen that the main Airbnb data is sourced from areas nearby the New York county, mainly in areas of Bronx, Nassau, New York, Kings and Queens. However, there are some sparse distributions of Airbnb's in the other counties such as Erie, Allegany, St. Lawrence and others. Looking at this distribution, it seems that Saratoga has the highest average price for Airbnb's across the
                        whole of New York. However, this might be skewed due to the lack of data in these other counties. Among Queens, Kings, Bronx and New York counties, they all have a similar average Airbnb price ranging from a minimum average of $632.25 in New York
                        to as high as $632.44 in Bronx.

                    <p> From this pie chart we are able to visualise the distribution of Airbnb's across the data. From here, it can be observed that most of the Airbnb's listed are located in the New York, Kings, Queens, Bronx and Nassau counties, while the rest make up
                        a small portion of the observations.

                    <h2> Reviews and Price, Are they related? </h2>
                    <p> The comparison between price and average rating seems to have no specific trend, rather than that, most Airbnb's seem to be clustering at the $630 price point and an average rating of 3.3 out of 5. Out of the 4 counties, New York is the one that
                        has the least variance, having most of their Airbnb's tightly packed within that cluster. There are some neighbourhood groups in which seem to be outliers in the data, due to mainly low number of reviews. These are the annotated Little Neck and Glen Oats,
                        having the highest average price and average rating respectively. Overall, this seems to suggest that the Airbnb market in New York has stayed consistent throughout all its counties, averaging at a price point of $630 and an average rating of 3.3.

                        was made due to most Airbnb's are located in these 4 counties throughout New York. The first chart indicates that hotel rooms seem to have the highest average ratings, and is even at a 5 rating for Queens. Furthermore, the missing bar in Bronx indicates that
                        Airbnb's in Bronx seem to be focused more on entire homes and apartments, private and or shared rooms, rather than luxury hotel rooms. Regarding cancellation policy, there is a slight difference between being moderate, flexible and strict for these 4 counties,
                        with moderate having slightly higher reviews in Kings, New York and Bronx.</p>
